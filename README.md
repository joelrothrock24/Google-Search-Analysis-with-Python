Google Search Analysis with Python - Pytrends, search interest, historical hourly interest, regions

This project provides a comprehensive guide to analyzing Google search trends using Python, explicitly using the Pytrends library. Pytrends is an unofficial API that allows users to interact with Google Trends data, enabling the analysis of search interest over time, across regions, and among related queries. Based on the vast volume of search data processed by Google daily, this analysis can reveal valuable insights into public interest and behavior.

The project begins by introducing Pytrends and guiding users through its installation. Once Pytrends is set up, users learn how to connect to Google Trends and build a payload for their search queries. This involves specifying keywords, timeframes, and categories to tailor the search data to specific needs.

Subsequent sections delve into the methods Pytrends provided to extract and analyze data. The "Interest Over Time" method tracks the popularity of search terms over specified periods, while "Historical Hourly Interest" offers a granular, hourly breakdown of search interest. The "Interest by Region" method highlights geographic variations in search popularity, and "Top Charts" identifies the most searched topics annually. "Related Queries" and "Keyword Suggestions" also provide insights into associated search terms and potential new keywords to explore.

The project includes practical examples and code snippets for each method, demonstrating how to retrieve and visualize data using Python libraries such as pandas and matplotlib. By following this guide, users can harness the power of Google Trends to uncover trends, patterns, and insights relevant to their areas of interest or research.
